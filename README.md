# liri-node-app
#### In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

##### Here you will be able to find information about your favorite movies, artists, bands, as well as their concert's date and location.

## The commands that are applicable to this app are:
*concert-this

*spotify-this-song

*movie-this

*do-what-it-says

##### It is important to note, that if you want to try it out you have to put first
#### _*node liri.js*_ and then the command.

### Example:
node liri.js movie-this 'High School Musical'

##### You can find screenshots on how Liri looks like and how it works on the file called "screenshots".

*The only thing I'm missing in this project is whenever you want to display "spotify-this-song", I did a lot of research on how to fix the problem I was having with that command but nothing seemed to be helpful; whenever I put 'node liri.js spotify-this-song' the only thing that appeared was 'this is loaded'.
