# liri-node-app
#### In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
##### Here you can will be able to find information about your favorite movies, artists, bands as well as their concert's date and location.

## The commands that are applicable to this app are:
*concert-this

*spotify-this-song

*movie-this

*do-what-it-says

##### it is important to note, that if you want to try it out you have to put first
#### _*node liri.js*_ and then the command.

### Example:
node liri.js movie-this 'High School Musical'

###### you can find screenshots on how liri looks and works on the file called "screen shots".
